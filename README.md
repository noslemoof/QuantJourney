## Introduction
Hello, everyone. Welcome to my publicly available codes for modelling various financial instruments. It is my goal to share the joys of financial and quantitative modelling to everyone. Therefore, even if it means increasing the competition in the space I hope to work in, I would still love to share my results and findings publicly
However, with that I would hope that my work to be respected and that you wouldnt directly copy my source code and claim ownership of it
